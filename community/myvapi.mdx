## Introduction to MyVapi

### What is MyVapi?
MyVapi is a custom GPT designed to allow users to manage their Vapi accounts with ease. While the Vapi Dashboard provides limited functionality and using PostMan can be cumbersome, MyVapi offers a streamlined solution to interact with the Vapi API directly. This eliminates the back-and-forth usually associated with manual API interactions and JSON validation, making the process more efficient and user-friendly. The reason MyVapi was created is to help users understand the power of using VAPI's API. MyVapi uses 22 out of the 33 available VAPI APIs.
